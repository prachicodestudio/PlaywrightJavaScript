Create config file

Your Playwright setup is done.		


Session-03
---------------
1.  npx playwright test  //headless mode
Runs all Playwright tests across all configured browsers in headless mode.

For headed mode-
npx playwright test --headed //headed mode

2.  npx playwright test FirstTest.spec.js
Runs only the specified test file.

3.  npx playwright show-report
Opens the HTML report of the last test execution.

4.  npx playwright test FirstTest.spec.js --project=chromium
Runs the specified test file only on the Chromium browser.		

Runs the specified test file only on the Firefox browser.
    npx playwright test FirstTest.spec.js --project=firefox


Runs the specified test file only on the WebKit browser (Safari engine).
    npx playwright test FirstTest.spec.js --project=webkit

Notes: For headed  nmode

npx playwright test FirstTest.spec.js --project=chromium --headed

5. Run test in debug node (--debug)

npx playwright test FirstTest.spec.js --project=chromium --debug
								
The --debug option runs Playwright tests in debug mode.

It opens the browser in headed mode with the Playwright Inspector.

Test execution pauses step by step for better observation.

Useful for identifying locator issues, timing problems, and failures.

Helps visually debug and understand test behavior.

============

Locating Web element on the web pagae

1)property (id, name etc)
2)CSS selector
3)XPATH


Locate Single Web Element
-----------------------------------
🔹 Click (Link / Button)

await page.locator('selector').click()

* Preferred way to locate a single element and click (auto-wait enabled).

await page.click('selector')
* Shortcut method to find and click an element using a selector.

🔹 Input Box (Text Field)

await page.locator('selector').fill('value') //Clears existing text and enters the new value (recommended).

await page.locator('selector').type('value') //Types value character by character without clearing existing text.

await page.fill('selector', 'value')

* Shortcut method to clear and fill an input field.

Locate Multiple Web Elements
-----------------------------
const elements=await page.$$('selector')


































* Returns an array of all elements matching the selector.


## Assertions (Verification)

```js
await expect(page).toHaveURL(/partial-url/)
```

* Verifies page URL using partial match (regex).

```js
await expect(page.locator('selector')).toHaveText('Text')
```

* Verifies exact visible text of an element.

```js
await expect(page.locator('selector')).toBeVisible()
```

* Checks whether the element is visible on the page.

---

## Best Practices

* ✅ Prefer `page.locator()` over direct methods
* ✅ Use `fill()` instead of `type()` for inputs
* ✅ Use `$$()` only when multiple elements are expected
* ✅ Keep selectors simple (CSS > XPath when possible)

---

## Example (Login Flow)

await page.goto('https://example.com')
await page.fill('#username', 'user1')
await page.fill('#password', 'pass123')
await page.click('#login')
await expect(page).toHaveURL(/dashboard/)
```

Built-in locators


Playwright built-in locators are smart ways to find elements like a real user sees them.
They are auto-waiting, strict, and accessibility-based, so tests are stable and easy to maintain.


Main built-in locators:

getByRole → element ka role (button, textbox, link) //saucedemo, login button , https://practice.expandtesting.com/secure

getByText → visible text //verify product on saucedemo website

getByLabel → form field ka label //https://practice.expandtesting.com/secure

getByPlaceholder → input placeholder text   //saucedemo , username & password

getByAltText → images ka alt text //saucedemo

getByTitle → title/tooltip

getByTestId → test-only attribute (last option)

Record & Play test script in Playwright - code generator

what is code generator

In Playwright  a Code Generator (Codegen) is a built-in tool that records your browser actions and automatically generates Playwright test code for you.
It’s mainly used by beginners or for quick test creation.

codegen = Record + generate test script


to open code gen in terminal -
npx playwright codegen https://www.saucedemo.com

it will open two things
1. browser
2. playwright inspector


Frequently used codegen options
--------------------------------
1) Start Codegen Without URL
npx playwright codegen

2) Auto-save to a file (MOST USED)
npx playwright codegen https://example.com --output tests/login.spec.js


3)Specify browser (default is chromium)
npx playwright codegen --browser=chromium
npx playwright codegen --browser=firefox
npx playwright codegen --browser=webkit

4) specify language

npx playwright codegen https://example.com \
  --lang=javascript \
  --output tests/demo.spec.js

5) emulate device browser window
npx playwright codegen https://example.com --device="iPhone 12"

6) Set browser window size (height & width)
--viewport-size=WIDTH,HEIGHT
npx playwright codegen https://example.com --viewport-size=375,667

Record Assertions Automatically

Session-07
----------
Topic: Assertions (Playwright)

1. Page-Level Assertions

Used to validate the overall page state like title and URL, ensuring the correct page is loaded before proceeding.

Examples:

toHaveTitle()

toHaveURL()

2. Element State Assertions

Used to verify the UI readiness of elements—whether they are visible, enabled, or editable before interaction.

Examples:

toBeVisible()

toBeEnabled()

toBeEditable()

toBeHidden()

3.  Text & Value Assertions

Used to validate text content or input values, ensuring correct data is displayed or entered.

Examples:

toHaveText()

toContainText()

toHaveValue()

4. Attribute 

Used to verify HTML attributes, IDs, classes
 
Examples:

toHaveAttribute()

toHaveId()

toHaveClass()



5. Count Assertions

Used to verify the number of matching elements, helpful for lists, tables, and product counts.

Example:

toHaveCount()

6. Screenshot / Visual Assertions

Used to perform visual UI validation by comparing current UI with a baseline image; supports masking for dynamic content.

Examples:

toHaveScreenshot()

mask for dynamic elements (cart count, time, etc.)


Session-08
-----------

1. Recap: Hard Assertions

Hard assertions stop test execution immediately when they fail.

await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Swag Labs');


If this fails → test stops.

2. Problem with Hard Assertions

Only first failure is reported

Remaining validations are skipped

Not suitable for validating multiple UI elements

3. What Are Soft Assertions?

Soft assertions allow test execution to continue even if an assertion fails.

All failures are reported at the end of the test.

4. Soft Assertions in Playwright

Playwright provides soft assertions using expect.soft().

Syntax:
await expect.soft(actual).toBe(expected);

5. Demo Website

SauceDemo
https://www.saucedemo.com/

6. Example Use Case

Validate:

Page title

URL

Login form elements

Product page heading

Even if one validation fails, test should continue.

7. Hard vs Soft Assertion Comparison
Hard Assertion	Soft Assertion
Stops test on failure	Continues execution
Suitable for critical flows	Suitable for UI validation
Single failure reported	Multiple failures reported
8. When to Use Soft Assertions

UI checks (labels, headings, icons)

Non-critical validations

Visual consistency checks

9. When NOT to Use Soft Assertions

Login failure

Payment failure

Data creation failure

10. Key Takeaway

Use hard assertions for flow control
Use soft assertions for UI validation
