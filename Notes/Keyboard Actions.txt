Keyboard Actions
-------------------
 1. Keyboard actions always work on the focused element
If a textbox or textarea is not focused,
keyboard input will either go to the page or may not work at all.

2. keyboard.press() performs a complete key action
It includes:

key press

key release

So it is best for single keys or shortcut keys.

3. keyboard.down() and keyboard.up() are used to hold keys
Used for scenarios like:

Shift + Arrow selection

Ctrl + multiple key actions

This helps in showing real user-like keyboard behavior.

4. Keyboard shortcuts are different on Windows and Mac

Windows → Control

Mac → Meta (Command key)

In this demo, Windows shortcuts are used.

5. Text selection using arrow keys depends on cursor position
That’s why:

Cursor is moved to the beginning using Home

Then Shift + ArrowRight is used to select text

6. Keyboard actions trigger real JavaScript keyboard events
Messages like:

You entered: A

You entered: ENTER

prove that Playwright behaves like a real keyboard.

7. keyboard.type() vs fill()

type() → types character by character (real typing effect)

fill() → directly sets the value
